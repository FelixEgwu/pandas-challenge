Conclusion
The clear conclusion of this analysis is that Charter schools perform much better than district schools on both the math and reading test. The charter schools pass both tests at rates right around 90% while the district schools have barely over half the students who pass both test. All 7 District schools perform below average on both math and reading test while all 8 charter schools are well above average in terms of their scores. WHile the district schools are typically larger than the chartrer schools there isn't much a relationship in terms of school size and how well the kids do on the nor does the money spent per student give a clear view of benefits in terms of test performance.
